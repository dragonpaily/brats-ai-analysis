End-to-End Brain Tumor Analysis Pipeline
This repository contains the code for a complete pipeline for brain tumor analysis from MRI scans, developed based on the BraTS 2024 challenge dataset. The project uses a high-performance 3D U-Net for semantic segmentation and integrates with a Large Language Model (Gemini 1.5 Flash) to generate descriptive reports from the segmentation results.

This project is structured as a modular, reusable, and professional research codebase, suitable for extension and reproduction.

ðŸ“Š Performance
The core segmentation model was trained and validated on the BraTS 2024 dataset. It achieved the following mean Dice Scores on a hold-out test set of 203 patients:

Tumor Region                   Mean Dice Score

Enhancing Tumor (ET)            0.7743



Tumor Core (TC)                 0.8443



Whole Tumor (WT)                0.8813



Average (ET, TC, WT)            0.8333



âœ¨ Features
High-Performance 3D U-Net: A robust 3D neural network architecture with residual connections and deep supervision for accurate segmentation.

Advanced Loss Function: A custom combo_loss that combines Focal Tversky and Dice losses to effectively handle the severe class imbalance in tumor data.

Modular & Reproducible Codebase: The code is structured into separate modules for data utilities, model architecture, and analysis, following best practices for research software engineering.

LLM-Powered Reporting: Integrates with the Google Gemini API to automatically generate structured, descriptive reports from the calculated tumor volumes, providing a proof-of-concept for AI-driven interpretation.

ðŸš€ Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.9+

An NVIDIA GPU with CUDA and CuDNN installed is recommended for model inference.

A Google Gemini API Key.

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/dragonpaily/brats-ai-analysis.git 
cd brats-ai-analysis


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Download Model Weights:
Download the trained model weights (best_model.weights.h5) from 

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_FfzkPQOW53Q-hZeU1PJGQONm70vTz7G/view?usp=sharing
 and place them in a checkpoints/ folder in the root directory.

Set up Gemini API Key:
For the report generation to work, you need to provide your API key as an environment variable:

export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"


Usage
To run the full analysis pipeline on a single patient's data, use the predict.py script. You must provide the path to the patient's data folder and the patient's ID.

python scripts/predict.py \
    --patient_data_dir /path/to/your/BraTS_data/ \
    --patient_id BraTS-GoAT-00000 \
    --model_weights /path/to/your/checkpoints/best_model.weights.h5 \
    --output_dir /path/to/save/results/
